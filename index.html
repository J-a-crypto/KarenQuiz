                Hey Karen! Before I say anything else, congratulations on becoming 22! üéâ
                You can finally say that Taylor Swift made a song about you!
                I just wanted to say that you are one of the most kindest, genuine, and funniest Ecuadorian people I
                know.
                Don't flatter yourself too much, my standards are low. You really made my experience in Just Salad
                better and
                those work shifts more tolerable. It's not just my experience in Just Salad, you've made in impact in my life with your words and just the way you live life. 
                You really are a unique and loving person. This means that you gotta keep loving yourself and there should never be a doubt in your mind if you are enough because
                you are. I am glad that I got to know you and we became friends,
                and I hope we can continue to be friends for a long time. Keep effecting people's lives in the positive manner.
                I can't wait to see what the future holds for you and if you get to meet your Henry Cavil, Mr.Darcy,
                Percy, that customer named Mario, or the guy from Hunger Games.
                I hope you enjoy the quiz and cheers to many more years of cousinship! ü•Ç
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1em;">PS. Remember I hate to show you the reality of life. So just keep overcoming the
                hate. c:</p>
